Science package use case examples
---------------------------------

IMG: Extended Sources (4mas, MCAO, Ks filter)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- View a galaxy with star formation regions over the middle MICADO detector
- Use a strehl ratio of 35% in the Ks-filter
- Observe for 60 x 60s DITs and stack them

IMG: Point sources (1.5mas, SCAO, Pa-Beta filter)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- View a cluster of stars in the central detector
- Use a field varying PSF, with strehl of 20% in J, dropping off with radius from centre

IMG: Astrometric sub-pixel shifts (1.5mas, SCAO, J filter)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Generate a group of stars with different velocities
- Observe the group at two epochs
- Extract the positions and show change in position

SPEC 50x15000, HK, slit aligned with parallactic angle, no ADC
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


SPEC 20x3000, J, slit at 45 deg to zenith
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

HCI (not yet implemented)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
- possible hack to get this working
