\texttt{speXtra} is a tool to manage and manipulate astronomical spectra. 

Documentation: \url{https://spextra.readthedocs.io/}

\subsection{Functionality%
  \label{functionality}%
}

\texttt{speXtra} packages several \texttt{synphot} workflows
workflows in simple-to-use methods that allow the user 
to manipulate astronomical spectra. For example, the user
can extract the magnitude from an astronomical spectrum or 
scale the specrum, the spectrum can be redshifted or 
blueshifted or smoothed with a velocity kernel, add emission or
absorption lines, rebin the spectra or correct it for an
extinction curve. Etc.

\texttt{speXtra} does not perform measurements, with the sole 
exception of extracting magnitudes within a band. 

\texttt{speXtra} also comes with a built-in database of spectral templates 
that cover many possible user cases. Loading these templates is as
easy as typing \texttt{Spextrum("library_name/template_name")}
 

\subsubsection{Spectral Templates}

At the time of writting the following libraries are included in \texttt{speXtra}. Other can be added 
at request of the user. 

\begin{itemize}

\item The Kinney-Calzetti Spectral Atlas of Galaxies

\item Pickles Stellar Library

\item SDSS galaxy composite spectra

\item IRTF spectral library

\item AGN templates

\item Emission line nebulae

\item Galaxy SEDs from the UV to the Mid-IR

\item Kurucz 1993 Models (subset)

\item Supernova Legacy Survey templates (subset)

\item Flux/Telluric standards with X-Shooter

\item High-Resolution Spectra of Habitable Zone Planets (example)


\end{itemize}
