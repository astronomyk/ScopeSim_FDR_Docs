\ScopeSim{} incorporates parts of Bernhard Rauscher's HxRG Noise Generator package for Python\cite{nghxrg}.
\ScopeSim{} uses the following common 3rd party python packages as dependecies: Numpy\cite{numpy}, Scipy\cite{scipy}, Astropy\cite{astropy1, astropy2}, Synphot\cite{synphot}, Pyyaml, Aniscoado\cite{anisocado}.
Optional dependencies include: Matplotlib\cite{matplotlib}, Jupyter\cite{jupyter}
%This research made use of \lstinline{Astropy}, a community-developed core Python package for astronomy\cite{astropy1, astropy2}.
%This research made use of \lstinline{Synphot}\cite{synphot}.
\ScopeSim{} makes use of atmospheric transmission and emission curves generated by ESO's SkyCalc service, which was developed at the University of Innsbruck as part of an Austrian in-kind contribution to ESO\cite{skycalc1, skycalc2}.
This research is partially funded by the project IS538004 of the Hochschulraumstrukturmittel (HRSM) provided by the Austrian Government and administered by the University of Vienna.
The authors would also like to thank all the members of the consortium for their effort in the MICADO project, and their contributions to the development of this tool.
