ScopeSim is a flexible multipurpose instrument data simulation ecosystem built in python.
It enables both raw and ideal observation data to be simulated for a wide range of telescopes and instruments quickly and efficiently on regular laptops.
This is achieved by keeping the instrument model data, descriptions of the target objects, and simulation engine strictly separated.
The three main packages are the ScopeSim engine, a library of target templates, and the instrument reference database.
Several existing and future telescope and instrument systems have been already been implemented, with more to come in the future.
For example, work is steadily progressing on the instrument packages for the MICADO and METIS instruments at the ELT.
All the code and data is open source and hosted on Github.
The community is also most welcome, and indeed encouraged to contribute to code ideas, target templates, and instrument packages by either opening an issue or submitting a pull request on Github.
